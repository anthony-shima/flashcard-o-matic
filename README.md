This application lets users create, view, and edit flashcards and decks. Decks, which are groups of flashcards, can be created without limit, helping users to focus on specific study topics. The applicationâ€™s data storage is handled by Json-Server, which runs alongside the 'Flashcard' client.

### Home Page
The 'Home Page' provides an overview of all available decks and includes several control buttons.

The 'Create Deck' button allows users to create a new deck.

Within each deck, there are 'View', 'Study', and 'Delete' buttons.

The 'View' button takes users to a new page where they can see the collection of flashcards within the deck. The 'Study' button lets users go through each flashcard in the deck. The 'Delete' button removes the deck.

The 'Edit' button navigates the user to the respective edit page for the deck or individual cards, allowing modifications to be made.

The 'Study' button lets the user review all the cards in the deck, displaying the front (question or term) and back (answer or definition) of each card.

### Study Deck Page
When the user clicks the 'Study' button on the Home page or the View Deck page, they will be directed to the 'Study Deck Page.'

The following three screenshots illustrate the initial, middle, and final stages of the user's experience as they review the cards in a deck.

1. The user first sees the front side of a card along with a 'Flip' button, which allows them to view the backside of the card. If the backside is already displayed, the 'Flip' button will return to showing the front side.

3. As the user progresses through the cards but has not yet reached the end of the deck, they will see both a 'Flip' button and a 'Next' button. The 'Flip' button lets the user toggle between the front and backside of a card, while the 'Next' button moves them to the next card in the deck.
